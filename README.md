# Time-based-error-sqli
This project is a Python-based time-blind SQL Injection extractor for PostgreSQL. It uses pg_sleep() delays to infer data, automating password extraction for the administrator user. Characters are tested one by one through ASCII values, and the password is revealed live in the terminal as itâ€™s being extracted.
